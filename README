SciMax is a toolbox for Scilab to connect it with Maxima

To install it :
	
	- check the path of the Overload Toolbox
	- start Scilab and type "%otb_path='path of ov_toolbox';" and "exec builer.sce;"
	- you need to have Maxima compiled with GCL or CLisp;

For the moment expressions, matrices, sets and lists are managed. Next version should manage other types (graph for example)

Note:

I wrote this toolbox under Debian Lenny with kernel 2.6.26, Scilab 5.1.1, gcc 4.3.2, clisp 2.44.1 and gcl 2.6.7. 
I tested the versions 5.13.0, 5.17.0, 5.17.1, 5.18.1 compiled with GCL and CLisp
 and all is good.

The main difference between SciMax 2.x and 1.x is that the binary datas are not transmitted via binary pipe. I met several difficulties under Ubuntu and Fedora to compile correctly the C files used by Maxima (bugs in GCL, difficulties to recompile GCL, Clisp not compiled with --with-dynamic-modules under Fedora, ...). So I decided to convert numerical data in Scilab into strings and to pass them in the command-line (which is less efficient, but everybody have not a Debian system ... :o( )
