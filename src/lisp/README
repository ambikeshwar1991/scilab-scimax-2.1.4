The toolbox can be used with Maxima compiled with GCL or CLISP.

You can test the files in Maxima in setting the environment variable SCIMAX_TOOLBOX_PATH and in launching Maxima with :
    maxima -p loader.lisp

and build them with :
    maxima -p make.lisp

If in Scilab you got the error message "Maxima started but it could not load scimax or scimath...", type in a shell :
   maxima -p scimax

and send the output to :
